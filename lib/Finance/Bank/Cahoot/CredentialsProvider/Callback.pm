=head1 NAME

 Finance::Bank::Cahoot::CredentialsProvider::Callback - Credentials provider that uses callbacks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $credentials =  Finance::Bank::Cahoot::CredentialsProvider::Callback->new(
     credentials => [qw(account password)],
     options => { account => sub { return '12345678' },
                  username => sub { return 'username' },
                  password => sub { return substr('verysecret', $_[0]-1, 1) } });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an implementation of a credentials provider where each of
the credentials is provided by a user-supplied callback. All callbacks return a
text string. Any callback may be optionally supplied a character offset in the
credentials value (first character is 0).

=head1 METHODS
