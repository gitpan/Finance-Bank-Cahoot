=head1 WARNING

This warning is from Simon Cozens' C<Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB>, and seems
just as apt here.

This is code for B<online banking>, and that means B<your money>, and
that means B<BE CAREFUL>. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit
the source of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not
doing anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful
to me, but is provided under B<NO GUARANTEE>, explicit or implied.

=head1 NOTES

This has only been tested on my own accounts. I imagine it should work on any
account types, but I can't guarantee this.
