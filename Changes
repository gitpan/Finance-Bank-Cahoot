1.07    16 September 2010
        Cahoot web application has changed name to AquariusSecurity and
        a number of URLs are now also different.

1.06    4 July 2010
        Direct debits format on cahoot.com has changed again.

1.05    17 September 2009
        Updated Finance::Bank::Cahoot::DirectDebit to cope with new Cahoot
        direct debit page format.

1.04    06 February 2009
        Compressed test pages after Google flagged them as a phishing scam.

1.03    30 September 2008
        New debits() method for Finance::Bank::Cahoot that returns a
        list of active direct debits.

1.02    18 August 2008
        No functional changes to modules. Fixed invocation of isa() in
        tests to isa_ok() to resolve module @INC ordering issue.

1.01    16 August 2008
        Replaced use of Date::Parse in statement line extraction as it
        often gets confused by US vs. American date formats. Replaced
        by a conversion that assumes DD/MM/YY dates (safe since this
        is a UK bank after all) supplied by Nick Woolley.

1.00    15 April 2008
        Bumping version number since the module has now successfully
        connected to 3 independent Cahoot accounts, so seems to be
        stabilising.

0.07    11 March 2008
        Fixed extraction of password character numbers greater than 9.
        Added check for incorrect login: now croaks when detected. Fixed
        WWW::Mechanize warning (via HTML::Form) for read-only input.

0.06    03 March 2008
        Corrected parsing of statement lists to include the first on the
        list.

0.05    26 February 2008
        No use-visible changes. Added test for examples. Corrected META.yml.

0.04    24 February 2008
        Replaced text for file not found error in 05-cryptfile.t to be
        locale agnostic.

0.03    22 February 2008
        Fixed return value of the accounts method of Finance::Bank::Cahoot
        to be a reference to a list, as documented. Added tests for system
        error pages returning from the Cahoot server for better diagnostics.

0.02    19 December 2007
        Added new classs Finance::Bank::Cahoot::Statement and
        Finance::Bank::Cahoot::Statement::Entries which are now used as
        return types from the snapshot and statement methods of
        Finance::Bank::Cahoot.

        POD documentation has been tidied in a number of areas.
